# gcc-building
a simple shell script to download/configure/build/install gcc




This is a simple building script I borrowed and modified from web. It simplify the procedure of downloading gcc and its prerequisite library, configuration and building etc. It accept a single gcc version as parameter to build gcc at $HOME/tmp and installed at $HOME/opt.

It builds with x86_64 and most common configuration. No build check to run which can last very long.
